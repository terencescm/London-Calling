    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "Hey! Great job getting through those challenging DataCamp courses. You're learning a lot in a short span of time. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you're going to apply the skills you've been learning, bridging the gap between the controlled environment of DataCamp and the *slightly* messier work that data scientists do with actual datasets!\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s the mystery we’re going to solve: ***which boroughs of London have seen the greatest increase in housing prices, on average, over the last two decades?***\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A borough is just a fancy word for district. You may be familiar with the five boroughs of New York… well, there are 32 boroughs within Greater London [(here's some info for the curious)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_boroughs). Some of them are more desirable areas to live in, and the data will reflect that with a greater rise in housing prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "***This is the Tier 3 notebook, which means it's not filled in at all: we'll just give you the skeleton of a project, the brief and the data. It's up to you to play around with it and see what you can find out! Good luck! If you struggle, feel free to look at easier tiers for help; but try to dip in and out of them, as the more independent work you do, the better it is for your learning!***\n",
    "\n",
    "This challenge will make use of only what you learned in the following DataCamp courses: \n",

    "- Data Types for Data Science\n",

    "- pandas Foundations\n",
    "- Manipulating DataFrames with pandas\n",
    "- Merging DataFrames with pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "Of the tools, techniques and concepts in the above DataCamp courses, this challenge should require the application of the following: \n",
    "- **pandas**\n",
    "    - **data ingestion and inspection** (pandas Foundations, Module One) \n",
